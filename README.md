This app lets you type your location; it then finds the yahoo weather API and looks through the JSON to find 
today's temperature, to show you what kind of coat you need to wear. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fix an IndexOutOfRange error, 
which indicated that something is still going wrong in the FetchJSON class.
